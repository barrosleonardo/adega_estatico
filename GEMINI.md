This project contains the static HTML, CSS, and image files for the Adega 101 landing page.

## Project Overview

Adega 101 is a smart wine cellar system designed for hospitality services like Airbnb and other vacation rentals. It provides an automated self-service system for guests to purchase wine, increasing revenue for the host and enhancing the guest experience.

## Technologies Used

*   HTML5
*   CSS3 (with custom properties/variables)
*   JavaScript (for smooth scrolling, mobile menu, FAQ toggles, and form handling)

## File Structure

*   `adega_estatico.html`: The main HTML file for the landing page.
*   `adega_lovable.css`: This file seems to be a truncated or incomplete CSS file, with the primary styles being embedded directly in the HTML file.
